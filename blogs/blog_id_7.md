# Understanding Generators in Python

## Introduction
Generators are a special type of iterable in Python that allow you to create an iterator in a more memory-efficient way. They generate items one at a time and only when requested, making them useful for working with large datasets.

## How Generators Work
Generators utilize:
- **Yield**: A keyword that allows the function to return an intermediate result while maintaining its state.
- **Iterators**: Objects that implement the iterator protocol, which consists of `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.

## Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example of a generator function that yields the Fibonacci sequence:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Using the generator
for num in fibonacci(10):
    print(num)

### Difficulty: Easy

**XP**: 2x  
**Limits**: Time: 2, Memory: 256000

Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Codehaven, there lived a legendary adventurer known as **Captain Python**. Captain Python was renowned for his mastery of Pythonic arts—skills that helped him navigate through the most difficult programming challenges. Captain Python had a large army, and he started his tour to conquer the ocean. Help the captain solve the challenges he will face on his journey.

### Challenges

#### Challenge 1

Captain Python reunited with his lost brother, and together they decided to combine their armies to form a stronger one. **Concatenate the two lists of armies to create a new army**, and **print the combined army list**.

#### Challenge 2

During their westward journey, Captain Python discovers a **mysterious potion** that triples their team size. **Print the new army list formed after using the potion**. (Note: The initial list here is the combined army from Challenge 1.)

#### Challenge 3

Captain Python wants to know if they have an **"Archer"** in their team. **Print `True` if there is an Archer in the army**, otherwise print `False`.

#### Challenge 4

Captain receives news from his informers that there may be an **Enemy** in their army. **Print `True` if Enemy is NOT present in the army**, otherwise print `False`.

> **Note**: The challenges are sequential and interrelated.

### Input

1. The first line of input consists of the members of Captain Python’s army.
2. The second line of input consists of the members of Captain Python’s brother’s army.

### Output

1. First line: The army formed after combining Captain Python’s and his brother’s armies.
2. Second line: The army formed after consuming the mysterious potion.
3. Third line: `True` or `False` depending on whether an "Archer" is present in the army.
4. Fourth line: `True` or `False` depending on whether an "Enemy" is present in the army.

### Example

#### Input

```
Captain Lieutenant
Archer Captain
```

#### Output

```
['Captain', 'Lieutenant', 'Archer', 'Captain']
['Captain', 'Lieutenant', 'Archer', 'Captain', 'Captain', 'Lieutenant', 'Archer', 'Captain', 'Captain', 'Lieutenant', 'Archer', 'Captain']
True
True
```

### Solution

Here's a Python solution to complete the challenges sequentially:

```python
# Read Captain Python's army members and his brother's army members
list1 = input().split()
list2 = input().split()

# Challenge 1: Combine both armies into a single list
list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)

# Challenge 2: Triple the size of the army using the mysterious potion
print(list1 * 3)

# Challenge 3: Check if "Archer" is present in the combined army
if "Archer" in list1:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)

# Challenge 4: Check if "Enemy" is NOT present in the combined army
if not ("Enemy" in list1):
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)
```

---

This solution uses:

- `input().split()` to read each line and split it into lists of members.
- `extend()` to concatenate the lists for Challenge 1.
- List multiplication (`list1 * 3`) for Challenge 2 to simulate the potion's effect.
- Conditional checks (`in` and `not in`) to determine the presence of "Archer" and the absence of "Enemy" for Challenges 3 and 4.

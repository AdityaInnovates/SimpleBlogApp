# Collaborative DSA Blog Project

Welcome to the **Collaborative DSA Blog Project**! This repository allows contributors, regardless of coding experience, to share their knowledge on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with Python. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, your contributions can help students understand DSA problems more effectively.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **blogslist.json**: A JSON file located in the root directory where contributors add their blog details.
- **blogs/**: A folder containing markdown files (`.md`) with the body content for each blog.

## üìù Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Adding a New Blog Post

1. **Create a Unique Blog ID**:
   - Generate a random unique ID for your blog post.
   
2. **Update `blogslist.json`**:
   - Open `blogslist.json` in the root directory.
   - Add a new entry with the following format:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "unique_blog_id",    // Unique ID for the blog
       "image": "path/to/image",  // Link to the image (if any)
       "title": "Blog Title",     // Title of the blog
       "description": "Short Description"  // Brief summary
     }
     ```

3. **Create Blog Content**([Markdown Editor](https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html "Markdown Editor")):
